# Loan_Approval_Prediction
This project aims to predict loan approval status using a Random Forest classifier. The dataset contains various features related to the applicants' personal information, loan information, and credit history.

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a loan will be approved or not based on the applicant's details. The Random Forest classifier was chosen for its robustness and ability to handle imbalanced datasets.
